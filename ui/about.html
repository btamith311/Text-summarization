					<h3>About The Project</h3>
					<p>
						Summarization is the task of condensing a piece of text to a shorter version, reducing the size of the initial text while at the same time preserving key informational elements and the meaning of content. Since manual text summarization is a time expensive and generally laborious task, the automatization of the task is gaining increasing popularity and therefore constitutes a strong motivation for academic research.In the big data era, there has been an explosion in the amount of text data from a variety of sources. This volume of text is an inestimable source of information which needs to be effectively summarized to be useful. This increasing availability of documents has demanded exhaustive research in the NLP area for automatic text summarization.
						<br>
						<br>
						Using an extractive approach ensures that syntactic and semantic meaning is maintaned. It also enables the user to have a much more accurate summarization of the provided text. However, providing smaller (less than 5 lines) texts and trying to summaize them using this approach isn't entirely benefitial as drawing correlations and understanding the context becomes tedious. An ideal size of text would be between 10-30 lines, but a larger text could also be used, although this would need a longer processing time. 
						<br>
						<br>
						For a multitude of reasons, it was observed after comparison and evaluation that the BERT model works better than the LSTM model for this problem.

					<h3>API used</h3>
					<p>
						A RESTful API powers the UI behind this project.To summarize a piece of text, you can send a POST request with a raw/text content-type with the full summary. The summarizer API also includes a place where you can summarize news articles. This includes a custom text processor to attempt to remove unrelated content before summarization.
